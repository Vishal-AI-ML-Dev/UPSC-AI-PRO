Ruff: `All checks passed!`. compileall exit 0. Frontend `npm run build` ✓ and `npm run lint` clean.
Live workflow smoke (`docs/SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md`): not run — UNVERIFIED.

## Verified architecture facts
- Backend root is `src/` (ADR-001). API prefix `/api/v1`; all feature routers JWT-protected in `src/api/main.py`.
- "Supervisor" (`src/graph/supervisor.py`) = one structured LLM routing call → one of mentor / planner /
  evaluator / current_affairs / rag. No parallel or multi-step orchestration.
- The `rag` route is unreachable over HTTP (no route sets `persist_key`); CRAG (`src/graph/rag_graph.py`) only
  runs in `src/eval/llm_eval.py`.
- The only autonomous agent is the ReAct mentor in `src/graph/tools.py:build_tool_agent` (tools: `web_search`,
  `knowledge_base_search`; cap 3 rounds).
- `src/agents/*/graph.py` are plain functions, not LangGraph. NCERT/PYQ/Lecture/Upload are called directly by routes.
- LLM chains: Gemini 2.5 flash / flash-lite with Groq fallback (`src/core/llm.py`). Embeddings: Gemini, 768-dim.
- Vectors: one Qdrant collection per `persist_key` (`src/core/vector_store.py`). Chroma fallback broken
  (`langchain_chroma` not installed).
- Jobs: in-process `ThreadPoolExecutor(2)`, DB-persisted status only (`src/core/job_queue.py`).
- Checkpointer/store: Postgres when `DATABASE_URL` is Postgres; else SQLite checkpointer + in-memory store.
- Jev / TypeSafe: not present anywhere in the repository.

## Open risks (from the audit risk register; ranked)
| # | Risk | Sev | Planned phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ~~No ownership at vector boundary; LLM-chosen `persist_key`; global upload collections~~ CLOSED Phase 02 (ADR-007); legacy collections remain (cleanup backlog) | HIGH | 02 ✓ |
| 2 | Blocking work in `async def` handlers (single worker) | HIGH | 03 |
| 3 | Non-durable jobs; boot reaper fails sibling workers' jobs | HIGH/MED | 04 |
| 4 | Vector stack fails without Qdrant (Chroma not installed) | HIGH (misconfig) | 06 |
| 5 | Unbounded inputs → CLOSED Phase 02 (field + 1 MiB body limits, ADR-009); checkpoint history growth still open | MED | 03 |
| 6 | Auth rate limit → CLOSED Phase 02 (ADR-010, refresh excluded); account enumeration (register message, no dummy bcrypt) still open | MED | backlog |
| 7 | Tokens in `localStorage` | MED | backlog |
| 8 | ~~Upload size check relies on Content-Length; unbounded `_processed_cache`~~ CLOSED Phase 02 (byte-counted limits, bounded thread-safe per-user cache); upload memory ~2×50 MB/request open | MED | 03/04 |
| 9 | 24 h semantic cache can serve stale time-sensitive answers | MED | 06 |
| 10 | Eval gate tests CRAG path production never runs | MED | 08 |
| 11 | In-memory store fallback when not Postgres | MED | 09 |
| 12 | Migrations run per process; LangGraph tables outside Alembic | LOW–MED | 09 |
| 13 | `/health` checks nothing; no readiness/backups | MED | 09 |
| 14 | Exception text leaked; PII in logs → CLOSED Phase 02 for touched files (ADR-008); repo-wide log sweep + public `/docs` open | LOW | 09 |
| 15 | Dead/duplicate code; unused deps/settings | LOW | 09 (kept per ADR-006) |
| 16 | Non-blocking CI lint; no frontend tests; live smoke disabled | LOW | 09 |
| 17 | Compose: unpinned qdrant, default creds, exposed ports, unused redis | LOW | 09 |

## Doc drift (README.md / ARCHITECTURE.md claims contradicted by source) — RESOLVED in Phase 01 (2026-11-02)
All items below were corrected in place; claim → evidence table in `docs/phase-reports/phase-01-report.md`.
- "8 specialised agents behind one supervisor"; per-agent "LangGraph pipelines".
- "Hybrid retrieval" (lexical only re-scores dense candidates); "cross-encoder reranking" (off, deps missing).
- Citation enforcement via `compose_grounded_answer` (never called); "tenacity retries" (not imported).
- Local Chroma fallback (broken); stricter auth rate limit 10/300 s (not implemented).
- "Stateless API, add workers freely" (several in-process states; job reaper hazard).
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` lists `mentor.py` as a feature endpoint (unregistered).
- "669 offline tests" (574 test functions counted; with parametrize UNVERIFIED).

## Backlog (out-of-scope findings; add file, evidence, severity)
- README metrics not re-measured in Phase 01 (LOC counts, bundle sizes, chunk count). Baseline build shows `index-*.js`
  257.43 kB raw vs README "244 KB raw" (`README.md` §5) — LOW, UNVERIFIED.
- Startup log line uses an emoji (`src/api/main.py:79`); on a cp1252 Windows console logging raises
  `UnicodeEncodeError` (seen with `pytest -s`) — LOW.
- Test warnings: Starlette `httpx` TestClient deprecation; Alembic `path_separator` deprecation (`alembic.ini`) — LOW.
- FastAPI now wraps included routers (`_IncludedRouter`): `app.routes` no longer lists `APIRoute`s. Smoke test uses
  `app.openapi()` instead; any future code introspecting `app.routes` will break — LOW.
- `src/api/routes/mentor.py` unregistered but tested by `tests/test_stream_citations.py` — LOW.
- `src/agents/upload/upload.py` duplicate unauthenticated router (unmounted) — LOW.
- `src/index.css` stray in backend package; `tests/.gitignore` is UTF-16 — LOW.
- Config fields never read: `groq_fallback_models`, `openai_compat_*`, `groq_whisper_model`,
  `job_max_retries`, `job_timeout_seconds`, `rq_queue_name`, `auth_rate_limit_*` — LOW.
- Missing referenced files: `src/worker.py`, `scripts/cron_cleanup.py`, `tests/test_smoke_live.py` — LOW.
- `.dockerignore` excludes `*.md`, so `data/mentor_kb/*.md` is not in the image — LOW.
- (Phase 09) `src/agents/upload/upload.py` (dead, unmounted, unauthenticated; kept by ADR-006) still calls
  `process_upload(content, filename)` / `ask_upload(...)` without the now-required `user_id` and returns
  `detail=str(e)`. It would fail closed if mounted. Delete with user approval in Phase 09 — LOW.
- (Risk, ADR-010) `/auth/refresh` is limited only by the global per-IP limiter; if Render's proxy peer is not in
  `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`, all clients would share one global bucket — verify `request.client.host` on staging — MED.
- Version mismatch: pyproject 0.1.0 / app 2.0.0 / frontend 1.0.0; Streamlit-era defaults (port 8501) — LOW.

- (Phase 02) Legacy global collections `upload_<hash>` / `lecture_paste_<hash>` are kept but unread; plan a cleanup
  (needs user approval; never delete silently) — LOW.
- (Phase 02) Client-sent `book_info` (`/upload/chat`) and `topic_info` (`/lecture/chat`) dicts are unbounded and reach
  prompts unfenced (`src/agents/upload/graph.py` ask_upload, `src/agents/lecture/graph.py` ask_lecture); caller's own
  session only, capped by the 1 MiB body limit — LOW.
- (Phase 02) `src/agents/pyq/graph.py:_bank_key` falls back to a shared `"anon"` key for an empty user id; should raise — LOW.
- (Phase 02) Account enumeration: register returns "Email already registered"; `authenticate` skips bcrypt for unknown
  emails (timing) — MED.
- (Phase 02) `make_persist_key` lower-cases case-sensitive YouTube ids (public content collisions only) — LOW.
- (Phase 02) Upload memory: one request can hold ~2 × `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` and pypdf parses twice; queued jobs keep bytes in
  closures — MED (Phase 03/04).
- (Phase 02) NITs: `mount_mcp` logs a warning on every call (`src/mcp_server.py`); `_UploadCache.get` returns a shallow
  copy (nested `book_info` shared); f-string/filename/topic log lines remain (`src/agents/lecture/graph.py` "chat index
  ready", topic logs; `src/agents/pyq/graph.py` filename log); `TypeError` text still returned to the model
  (`src/graph/tools.py`); `UPLOAD_ENDPOINTS` hard-codes `/api/v1`; auth limiter is per worker without Redis — LOW.

### Last handoff — 2026-11-02
- Active phase: 03 Request-path performance — NEXT, not started (spec STUB, plan none). Phase 02 Security & ownership —
  DONE (spec DONE, plan DONE), committed as `c68f6a3 security: enforce document ownership and abuse limits` (not pushed).
- Done this session: Phase 02 end to end — spec + plan (`.claude/specs/phase-02-security-ownership.md`,
  `.claude/plans/phase-02-security-ownership.md`, 4 revisions + review amendment); deployment check; test-first security
  tests (8 new `tests/test_*` files + AC4 tests in `tests/test_tools.py`); R1–R15 incl. fail-closed MCP (R12-FC) across
  `src/` (new `src/core/errors.py`), frontend history trimming, `.env.example` placeholder; two review rounds + fixes;
  ADR-007..010 (`docs/DECISIONS.md`); report `docs/phase-reports/phase-02-report.md`; commit `c68f6a3`.
  Post-phase documentation cleanup (completed, not yet committed): `CLAUDE.md` known-facts line and
  `.claude/rules/security.md` vector-store rule now describe the Phase 02 ownership controls; resolved doc-drift backlog
  item removed from this file.
- Verified: `uv run pytest -q` → `1086 passed, 13 warnings in 146.43s (0:02:26)`; `uv run ruff check src tests` →
  `All checks passed!`; compileall exit 0; `npm run build` → `✓ built in 3.73s`; `npm run lint` → `All matched files use
  Prettier code style!`; security + code-quality re-review: 0 BLOCKING / 0 SHOULD-FIX; `git diff --check` clean for the
  documentation cleanup.
  Not verified: live Render dashboard settings (Q5) — UNVERIFIED; Render proxy peer vs `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` — UNVERIFIED;
  live workflow smoke (`docs/SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md`) — UNVERIFIED; push to remote — not done.
- In progress / next step: commit the documentation cleanup (on request), then `/start-phase 3`.
- Open questions for the user: Q5 (optional — R12-FC in place).
- Uncommitted changes: `M CLAUDE.md`, `M .claude/rules/security.md`, `M docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` (documentation only).
